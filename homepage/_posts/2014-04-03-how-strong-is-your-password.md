When we step into e-age, there are so many time we need to use internect to do 
things, and then there are so many password we need to use, the password like a 
key to the lock, we want the only-know guy is ourselves. But hackers can stole 
them so easy, because we use too many weak password. Thinking, how can the 
hackers do that, and how to avoid this things happen again, let us start to 
study, to know what we need?

#### Questions
* How to make a strong password?
* How long to crack a password by person machine?
* Is there any good and safe online site or software to calculate the strength 
  of password?
* How to calculate the strength of password?

#### Methods of crack
* **Dictionary attacks**  
  This is simple. The attackers just need to keep the 10^6 most common passwords 
  in use, and check each of them once. This can be done well under one second. 
  If your password is in the list, then it can probably be cracked nearly 
  instantaneously.
* **Brute force**  
  If your password isn't in a dictionary, then one other option is to use brute 
  force. The time taken to crack a password using this method depends on (a) the
  length of the password, and (b) the symbol set that comprises the password. 
* **Combined methods**  
  This relies on a combination of ingenuity and brute force. It's a mix between
  the first two methods, and relies on common "password conventions" rather than
  common passwords.

#### Implement code
* Implement with C [TODO]
* Implement with other language [TODO]
