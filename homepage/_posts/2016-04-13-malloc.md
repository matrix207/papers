### Algorithms
The main properties of the algorithms are:
* For large (>= 512 bytes) requests, it is a pure best-fit allocator,
  with ties normally decided via FIFO (i.e. least recently used).
* For small (<= 64 bytes by default) requests, it is a caching
  allocator, that maintains pools of quickly recycled chunks.
* In between, and for combinations of large and small requests, it does
  the best it can trying to meet both goals at once.
* For very large requests (>= 128KB by default), it relies on system
  memory mapping facilities, if supported.

### Test
* test code

		// gcc -o t t.c
		#include <stdio.h>
		#include <stdlib.h>

		#define ARRAY_SIZE(x) sizeof(x)/sizeof(x[0])

		void test(size_t require)
		{
			char* p = malloc(require);
			char* q = malloc(1);
			size_t size = malloc_usable_size(p);
			printf("memory require %lu, allocated %lu, address %p, next address %p, dis %ld\n",
					require, size, p, q, q-p);
			free(p);
			free(q);
		}

		int main()
		{
			int fast_bin[] = {1, 2, 4, 8, 20, 24};
			int small_bin[] = {25, 30, 40, 41, 50, 60, 64, 70, 72, 73};
			int large_bin[] = {1024, 128*1024, 135*1024, 256*1024, 512*1024, 1024*1024};
			int i=0;
			printf("-----------Fast bin: memory pool-------------\n");
			for (i=0;i<ARRAY_SIZE(fast_bin);i++) {
				test(fast_bin[i]);
			}
			printf("-----------Samll bin-------------\n");
			for (i=0;i<ARRAY_SIZE(small_bin);i++) {
				test(small_bin[i]);
			}
			printf("-----------Large bin-------------\n");
			for (i=0;i<ARRAY_SIZE(large_bin);i++) {
				test(large_bin[i]);
			}
			return 0;
		}

When require memory size less than 24, use fastbin to allocate memory; 
When require size large than 24, use smallbin
