I use a variety of vi(m) commands for my job, so many that I can't always 
remember how to do something that I have done before. Therefore I keep notes 
them here, for my bad memory.

### What is the difference between Vi and Vim
Vim is Vi improve, everything that in vi is available in vim.  
Here is some of the extended vim features:[ref](http://askubuntu.com/questions/418396/what-is-the-difference-between-vi-and-vim)  
1. Vim support syntax highlighting, code folding, etc.  
1. Vim allows the screen to be split for editing multiple files.  
1. Vim includes a built in diff for comparing files (vimdiff)  
1. Vim support plugins

	`dp` diff put, put the change from current file to another file

	### source vimrc, not need to exit vim to make config effective

	:so ~/.vimrc -> source specified file

	### run vi scripts under terminal
    vi -e -s -c ":%s/pattern/string/g" -c ":wq" file-name

	### Help
	:help symbol


### skills for program

1. open file on current cursor, use command `gf`; if the file is not in current 
	directory, use `:set path+=yourfilepath` to add more dir to the path, use 
	`:help path` for more info.

### some skills

1. command mode type `:nohl` cancel high light

2. substituttion  
sample lines:  
> \+ (http://www.google.com)\[google\]  
> \+ (http://www.wolframalpha.com/)\[wolfram\]  
into the lines:  
> \+ \[google\](http://www.google.com)  
> \+ \[wolfram\](http://www.wolframalpha.com/)  
Here is the command to do this:  
`:%s/+ \(.*\)\(\[.*\]\)/+ \2\1/g`  

3. compare file  
   `vimdiff file1 file2` or `gvim -d file1 file2`

4. digit operator  
	`ctrl+a` increment 1  
	`ctrl+x` subtract 1  

5. delete all comments  
	`:%s/\/\*\_.\{-}\*\//g` or `:%s#\M/*\m\_.\{-}\M*/##g`

6. delete match/unmatch lines  
	`:g/.*patternSearch.*/d`  
	`:v/#include/d` Delete all lines except "#include" lines  

7. more substitution  
	Substituting all lines with its line number  
	`:%s/^/\=line(".") . ". "/g`  
	Resort numeric  
	`:4,$s/\d\+/\=submatch(0) + 1/`  
	Insert sequence number to column position  
	`:%s/table\[\]/\='table[' . printf("%d",line(".")) . ']'/g`  
	`:%s/table\[\]/\='table[' . printf("%d",line(".")+9) . ']'/g` start from 10  

8. delete bank line  
	`:g/^$/d`  
	`:g/^ *$/d` delete lines only contain space   

9. add "inline" to all function  
	`:%s/\(.*(\)/inline \1/g`  this can work, but not perfect!!    
	`%s/\(^[□tab]*\)\(.*(.*\)/\1inline \2/g`  

10. delete all spaces at the end of every line:  
	`:%s/\(.*\)  *$/\1/`

11. read range of lines from another file to current file  
	`:r! sed -n 100,158p /home/dennis/test.c`

12. list all the match lines of searching on screen  
	`:g/pattern/p` In its longer format: `:global/regular-expression/print`  
	If `pattern` is leave out, like `:g//p`, vim will uses previous search item.  
	You can leave `p` out too, because p(rint) is the default action.

13. copy all lines containing a search pattern  
	`qaq` clear register a  
	`:g/pattern/y A` append all matching lines to register, then use `p` to paster them.

14. make a list number, reference [this](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Making_a_list_of_numbers)

	first, add this code to vimrc:  

		" Add argument (can be negative, default 1) to global variable i.
		" Return value of i before the change.
		function Inc(...)
		  let result = g:i
		  let g:i += a:0 > 0 ? a:1 : 1
		  return result
		endfunction

	then type `:so ~/.vimrc` to make it effective, and use command 
	`:let i = 1 | %s/ /\=' ' . Inc() . '.'/`

	before:  

		* How do you write a fast network server?
		* How do you write a network server that can handle 10000 clients?
		* What bottlenecks are there and how do you avoid them?

	after:  

		* 10.How do you write a fast network server?
		* 11.How do you write a network server that can handle 10000 clients?
		* 12.What bottlenecks are there and how do you avoid them?

	Test command `:let i = 0 | %s/f0/\='f' . Inc()/`

	before:

		<f0>int state;\l|\
		<f0>int iostate;\l|\
		<f0>int fd;\l|\
		<f0>struct session *session;\l|\

	after:

		<f0>int state;\l|\
		<f1>int iostate;\l|\
		<f2>int fd;\l|\
		<f3>struct session *session;\l|\

15. delete all space character at the end of each line  
	`:%s/\s\+$//g`  
	and for the beginning of each line is `:%s/^\s\+//g`

16. `g?` translate the selected content by [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13), using `u` to cancel operation

17. `:%TOhtml` translate to html format

18. Encrypt  
    method one `:set key=123456`, then save and quit `:wq`  
    method two `:X`, type the passwd twice，save and quit `:wq`  
    clean passwd `:set key= `, save and quit `:wq`

19. `autocmd FileType c,cpp set shiftwidth=4 | set expandtab` add to .vimrc, expand tab to be four space

20. `23,38w newfile` write the content between specify lines to file, `320,$ >>newfile` append to file

21. `23,38!sort` sort lines 23 through 38

22. `%s/  */\r/g` replace space as return  
    `%s/[ \t][ \t]*/\r/g` replace space or tab as return

23. `%s/\(\S\) \+/\1/g` delete all whitespace characters which after non-whitespace.

24. `:g/\[/,/\]/j` join multiple line to one
