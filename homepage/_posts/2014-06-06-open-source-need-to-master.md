	Commandline flags module for C++

* [glog](https://code.google.com/p/google-glog/)  
	Logging library for C++

* [gperftools](https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/) 
	Fast, multi-threaded malloc() and nifty performance analysis tools

* [gtest](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/)

### Other

* [libevent](http://libevent.org/)  
	an event notification library 

* [libnl](http://www.carisma.slowglass.com/~tgr/libnl/)  
	The libnl suite is a collection of libraries providing APIs to netlink protocol based Linux kernel interfaces. 

* [libunwind](http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/)  
	The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program

* [mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)  

* [snappy](https://code.google.com/p/snappy/)  
	A fast compressor/decompressor

* [fuse](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/)  
	With FUSE it is possible to implement a fully functional filesystem in a userspace program.  
	<http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/files/fuse-2.X/>
	
* [sshfs-fuse](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html)  
	This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.   
	Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy to set up: i.e.   
	on the server side there's nothing to do.    
	On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the server with ssh.  
	<http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/files/sshfs-fuse/2.5/>  
	
* [zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/)  
	Apache ZooKeeper is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination.
