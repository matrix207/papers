### Tools for detect time killer
* [OProfile](http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/news/)
* [PAPI](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/)

### Tips for Performance Improvement Code Optimization
* Optimize Your Code using Appropriate Algorithm
* Optimize Your Code for Memory
* Using operators
* If Condition Optimization
  - `if (a && b)`ï¼Œ place `b` first if `b` is more likely to be false
* Problems with Functions
* Optimizing Loops
  - It is faster to test if something is equal to zero than to compare two
    different numbers.

### memory allocate on stack or heap
Allocate memory on stack is more faster then heap cause of different architecture.
The heap is a far more complicated data structure than the stack.

### vector vs array
* Have same assembly instruction
  - index operation is same
  - dereference operation is same
  - increment operation is same
  - <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/381621/using-arrays-or-stdvectors-in-c-whats-the-performance-gap>
* But there are some attributes make vector slower than C array
  - Vector possible to store data in non-continuous chunk of memory
  - Vector allocate memory on heap always

* Another performance test between vector , boost array and C array

### Use the right container
* more container compare and select
  - vector is good at read data
  - list is good at insert and remove data
  - deque has good balance for read, insert and remove data

### Some tips when using C++
```
class Foo
{
    const BigObject & bar();
};

BigObject obj = foo.bar();  // OOPS!  This creates a copy!
const BigOject &obj = foo.bar();  // does not create a copy
```

### some books
* Effective C++
* More Effective C++
* Effective STL
* C++ Coding Standards
* Efficient C++: Performance Programming Techniques

### Know some compile and linker options
* gcc
