These days, I felt tired to do any coding. I couldn't descript the future of it.
So, I tryed to looking something in the Internet, which wasn't clear enough in 
my mind. Then, I found this article [Zhihu-Hit me hardly](http://www.zhihu.com/question/19589485), 
maybe a programmer should be like that.

A programmer, who want to improve his/her skills not only one directory, should 
read the projects listed as below:  

+ Operator system kernel  
  [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/)
+ Compiler  
  [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/)
+ Interpreter  
+ Database  
  [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
+ Web server  
+ Web browser  
  [Firefox](http://mozilla.org/firefox)
+ Editor  
  [vim](http://www.vim.org/)  
  [Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/)

There have published two books, one is [Beautiful code](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046), 
introduced much beautiful code, and [Beautiful Architectures](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517984) 
show lots of valued architectures.
